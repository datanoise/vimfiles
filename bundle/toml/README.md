# vim-toml

Vim syntax for [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml). May be somewhat buggy -- it's my first attempt at a
vim syntax file.

This was developed the following revision:
[888ac9d5](https://github.com/mojombo/toml/commit/888ac9d56edd8182fed3cf33e6a3325cf9bd6b5d).

## Installation

1. [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or GTFO
2. Clone/submodule into `$HOME/.vim/bundle/toml`, or wherever you've pointed your pathogen.
