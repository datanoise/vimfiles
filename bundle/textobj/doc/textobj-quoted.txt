INTRODUCTION					*textobj-quoted-introduction*

The *textobj-quoted* plugin provides two new |text-objects| which are
triggered by `aq` and `iq` respectively. These follow Vim convention, so that
`aq` selects _all_ of a quoted text, and `iq` selects the _inner_ portion of a
quoted text. So, the two text-objects defined will work with the following quoting chars:

- { }
- " "
- ' '
- ( )
- [ ]

Please note that the defined text-objects are single-line.
I find them very useful in situations like the following (* indicates cursor position):

- "some awes*ome text"
- (some awes*ome text)
- [some awes*ome text]
- {some awes*ome text}
- 'some awes*ome text'

In each case you could use commands like viq or ciq and select/cancel all the quoted text. 
Obviously, you can achive the same results using commands like *vi"* or "vi{". 
Indeed, the real benefit you'll get using this plugin is that you will have to remember the q char.
